tax
===
Hello everyone,

I am looking for people to help me develop a website that could allow us to perform an interesting experiment regarding taxation and the way the money is spent.

To make it simple, I believe most people are reluctant to pay taxes, not so much because it represents a sizeable bite into their hard-earned money, but because they feel that, at best, their money is spent inefficiently and in sectors they don’t care about, and at worst, it goes straight to the pockets of corrupt government officials and lobbyists and so on.

This is why I think it would be interesting to hear the voice of the people and let them choose, through a specifically designed website, how they want to spend their tax money. To do that, we simply need people to fill in some sociodemographic questionnaire so that we can make representative samples, answer questions about the amount of tax they pay and/or would be willing to pay, and then take them to a second page where they can basically move cursors on each major sector of government spending until all their money is spent. Once they have done that, I thought it would also be interesting to provide them with additional information such as the current government spending and “if everyone paid like you”, etc.

So what I need is people that can help me code a website and manage a database, and also any remarks that might improve that experiment or make me understand why it is doomed from the start. Also, if this is not the right place to post this kind of request, just tell me, and if you're kind enough, point me in the right direction (I've already posted this in another group and hope to find more success here).
If you are interested in any of those tasks, let me know.
